Javier Sanz Rodrigo, jsrodrigo@cener.com, July 2017

In this repository you can find the jupyter notebook that was used to evaluate the simulations submitted to the GABLS3 benchmark for wind energy applications: http://windbench.net/gabls-3 

The input data can be fetched from the EUDAT repository: 
http://doi.org/10.23728/b2share.f5d5a492d8aa4b7998b70abd68f5eae4 

and the validation data from the original GABLS3 website at KNMI:
